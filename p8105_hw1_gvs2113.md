This document will involve all problems associated with HW 1 for Data
Science (P8105).

## Problem 1

The following problem focuses on the use of inline R code, plotting and
the behavior of `ggplot` for different variables.

``` r
#Loading the `moderndive` library and the `early_january_weather` datasets

library(moderndive)

data("early_january_weather")
```

A description of the `early_january_weather` dataset can be found below:

To first identify the number of variables contained within this dataset,
I performed the following function:

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 15

From this, we now know that this dataset includes a total of 15
variables. They are entitled: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour.

Next, the total number of observations were found using the function
below:

``` r
nrow(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

This result shows that there are 358 total observations within the data
set.

``` r
#To continue with my data observation analysis, I loaded the tidyverse library in order to pull information about different variables and eventually plot the given data as well. 
library(tidyverse)
```

By taking a closer look at the data, we can determine the following
information about the provided data set variables:

- For all data observations, the origin, year and month variables all
  have the same values. This implies that each collected data point was
  gathered from an origin point that can be abbreviated as ‘EWR’, during
  the month of January, in the year 2013.
- Later on in this problem, the variables for temperature and for the
  recorded time (in hours) will be used to generate a plot. The
  temperatures ranged from 24.08, 57.92 degrees.
- Also, there is data provided for wind, precipitation, atmospheric
  pressure and other meteorological statistics included in this dataset.
  Upon closer inspection, I did notice that for many of the wind data
  observations, there are instances of missing or zero-valued data
  points within these variable categories.

**Overall, the mean temperature was 39.5821229 degrees.**

A scatterplot of temperature vs. time is shown below. A pdf version of
the generated plot will be saved within the project folder.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()+ ggtitle("Temperature vs. Time in Hours")
```

``` r
ggsave("hw1_scatterplot.pdf")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

By looking at the generated scatterplot, the data shows that over the
first ~2 weeks of January in 2013, the temperature trended upwards and
the humidity fluctuated with temperature. The peak in humidity was found
during the latter few days of data collection as temperatures began to
regulate before the final peak in temperature.

## Problem 2

Creating a data frame from instructions provided.

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10),
  vec_log = any(sample > 0),
  vec_char = vector(mode = "character", length = 10),
  vec_factor = factor(c("sun", "star", "moon", "star", "star", "sun", "moon", "moon", "star", "sun"), levels = c("sun", "star", "moon"))
)
```

Attempting to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe.

``` r
levels(problem2_df)
```

    ## NULL

Convert variables from one type to the other using `as.numeric`
function.
