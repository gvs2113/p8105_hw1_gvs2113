This document will involve all problems associated with HW 1 for Data
Science (P8105).

## Problem 1

The following problem focuses on the use of inline R code, plotting and
the behavior of `ggplot` for different variables.

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
    ## ✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4
    ## ✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0
    ## ✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1
    ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0
    ## ✔ purrr     1.0.2     
    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

A description of the `early_january_weather` dataset can be found below:

To first identify the number of variables contained within this dataset,
I performed the following function:

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 15

From this, we now know that this dataset includes a total of 15
variables. They are entitled: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour.

Next, the total number of observations were found using the function
below:

``` r
nrow(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

This result shows that there are 358 total observations within the data
set.

By taking a closer look at the data, we can determine that in January of
2013, the temperatures ranged from 24.08, 57.92 degrees, the maximum
precipitation was measured as 0.19 and the windspeed averaged 8.2258269.

Overall, the mean temperature was 39.5821229 degrees.

A scatterplot of temperature vs. time is shown below. A pdf version of
the generated plot will be saved within the project folder.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()+ ggtitle("Temperature vs. Time in Hours")
```
